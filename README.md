# World_Weather_Analysis
# Purpose
  Main purpose here is make a few suggested changes to PlanMyTrip app. These changes were suggested by the Beta testers. First change is to add the weather description field to the weather data that we already have. Beta testers can input their weather prefernce and filter this data and identify their potential travel destinations. From this list they can pick four cities to create a travel itinerary. We will be creating a travel route between these cities using the Google Maps Directions API. We will be adding a marker layer map also.
# Results
I chose minimum temperature as 75 and Max temperature as 90 to get my travel destinations data. Following are the cities that are part of the database

From the travel route you can see that Port Blair is an island and you have to come back the same way as you went in for this destination.
